            Bài hát: Lemon Tree - Fool's Garden

            I'm sitting here in a boring room
            It's just another rainy Sunday afternoon
            I'm wasting my time I got nothing to do
            I'm hanging around I'm waiting for you
            But nothing ever happens - and I wonder
            
            I'm driving around in my car
            I'm driving too fast I'm driving too far
            I'd like to change my point of view
            I feel so lonely I'm waiting for you
            But nothing ever happens - and I wonder
            
            *I wonder how I wonder why
            Yesterday you told me 'bout a blue blue sky
            And all that I can see
            It's just a yellow lemon tree
            
            I'm turning my head up and down
            I'm turning turning turning turning
            turning around
            And all that I can see
            It's just another yellow lemon tree*
            
            I'm sitting here I miss there power
            I'd like to go out taking a shower
            But there's a heavy cloud inside my head
            I feel so tired put myself into bed
            Where nothing ever happens - and I wond
            
            Isolation is not good for me
            Isolation I don't want to sit on the lemon-tree
            I'm steppin' around in the desert of joy
            Baby anyhow I'll get another toy
            And everything will happen and you wonder
            
            I wonder how
            I wonder why
            Yesterday you told me 'bout the blue blue sky
            And all that I can see is just another lemon-tree
            I'm turning my head up and down
            I'm turning turning turning turning turning around
            And all that I can see is just a yellow lemon-tree
            Yellow, wonder, wonder
            
            I wonder how
            I wonder why
            Yesterday you told me 'bout the blue blue sky
            And all that I can see, and all that I can see, and all that I can see
            Is just a yellow lemon-tree
